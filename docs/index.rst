pyBenD documentation
====================

**pyBenD**, which stands for Python Bend Dynamics, is a Python package dedicated to meandering system morphodynamic analysis. 

**pyBenD** consists in:
* a data structure that stores individual channel centerlines and successive centerlines of a same channel 
migrating over time from various input file format (csv, kml, etc.)
* tools that automatically detect meander bends and characteristics points such as inflection points, bend apex, or bend center
* tools to compute meander bend morphometric parameters
* tools to compute channel lateral migration rates
* tools to compute meander bend kinematics parameters.
